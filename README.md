## NLP Reading Group 

**Philosophy**: We want to read interesting papers, but without 
burning out the volunteers/presenters to 
keep the group going. 
We plan to meet every week (time and location TBD), 
where we take a few papers from our [shared repository](./papers.md), and 
read the abstract and the introduction of the paper then and there! 
Subsequently, we discuss the paper briefly. 
For some rare papers
that capture the excitement of many people, we may 
identify a volunteer to present the paper in detail.
